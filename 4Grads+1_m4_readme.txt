 A ) Note for TA:
1 - The game start at main menu, from there first navigate to “credit” page and return to the main menu. Please play “level 1” to see our particle system and audio polish.


 B) Menu:
There are three menu added to the game: 
1 - Main menu (loaded at the start, evoked by “M” keypress or accessed by pause menu)
2 - Credit page (accessed from the main menu)
3 - pause menu (accessed during game play by ESC button) 

The game start at main menu, with video texture and access to the levels and credit page.
During the play user can return to the main menu page by pressing “M” on keyboard. The credit page has all the team member information and sound credits. Both these two menus are designed to be visually appealing as required by the M4 and with appropriate musics.

Note for TA: Please do not access main menu from the pause menu. Simply press “M” to return back to main menu. Currently, the video/Audio effects of main menu are not loaded once accessed from pause menu. 

C) Audio (play level 1):

1 - There is a main audio theme
2 - There is a danger theme that fades in when the level gets difficult
3 - All interactive elements have audio attached
4 - Menus contain background sound also

D) Polish via particle effect(play level 1):

Three main particle effects were used to polish the game:

1 - When the character jumps the dust particle effect is evoked.
2 - Fountain particle effect is used in the level for visual purposes.
3 - The cannon balls are replaced by fireballs using particle effects.

Again, all these changes are better seen in level 1, so we ask TA to play the level 1.

If the TA would like to open the scenes from unity, “ALPHA_Scenes/MainMenu”, “ALPHA_Scenes/About” and “ALPHA_Scenes/level1” are the scenes to be used for m4 grading.
